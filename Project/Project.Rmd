## Introduction

This report presents an analysis of data on motor vehicle thefts from the New Zealand Police Department's vehicle of interest database. The dataset covers a period of six months and each record represents a single stolen vehicle.

## Step 1: Data Description

The dataset includes information about stolen vehicles, such as the type of vehicle, make, model year, color, the date it was stolen, and the region from which it was stolen.


The primary dataset `stolen_vehicles.csv` contains the following columns:

- `vehicle_id`: A unique identifier for each vehicle.
- `vehicle_type`: The type of the vehicle.
- `make_id`: An identifier for the make of the vehicle.
- `model_year`: The year of the vehicle model.
- `vehicle_desc`: A description of the vehicle.
- `color`: The color of the vehicle.
- `date_stolen`: The date when the vehicle was stolen.
- `location_id`: An identifier for the location where the vehicle was stolen.

Additional datasets include `locations.csv` and `make_details.csv`, which provide further details about the regions and vehicle makes, respectively.

The analysis aims to answer several key questions:

- What days of the week see the highest and lowest rates of vehicle theft?
- Which vehicle types are most and least frequently stolen? Does this vary by region?
- What is the percentage of stolen Luxury cars?
- What is the average age of the stolen vehicles, and does it vary based on the vehicle type?
- What is the number of thefts for different density levels?
- Which regions experience the most and least number of stolen vehicles? 

## Step 2: Data Loading

````{r loading datasets}
# import packages
library(data.table)


# import data, we use fread to get a data.table
locations = fread('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artyomashigov/CEU-R-intro-2024/main/Project/Data/locations.csv')
locations

str(locations)
````
We can notice that we have 16 different locations in our data. We have 5 columns: 3 text type, one numerical and one integer.
We can notice that population is text type. So we are going to change the type of the variable.

````{r make_details}
#import make details
make_details = fread('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artyomashigov/CEU-R-intro-2024/main/Project/Data/make_details.csv')
make_details

stolen_vehicles = fread('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artyomashigov/CEU-R-intro-2024/main/Project/Data/stolen_vehicles.csv')
stolen_vehicles
````

## Step 3: Data transformation and loading

## Step 5: Visualizations



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
